# Telecom Churn Case Study
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecom industries experiences an average of 15% to 25% annual churn rate. Given the fact it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain a existing customer. So customer retention become more important than customer acquisition.

## Business Objectives
* For many operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.To reduce customer churn, the operators need to predict which customers are high risk of churn.
* The goal is to build a machine learning model that can able to predict the churning customers using the given dataset.

## Structure of case study
1. Loading Input Data
2. Null Values Replacement and Feature Engineering
3. EDA
4. Standardization
5. PCA
6. Logistic regression
7. Random forest
8. Creating submission file
9. Conclusion



## Conclusion
 - We have used Random Forest as final model to create sample solution because its accuracy is 92.60 percent.
